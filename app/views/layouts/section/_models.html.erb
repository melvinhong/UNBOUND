          A Bachelor of Fashion Design graduate from Whitehouse Institute of Design. Found interest in working with the concept of androgynous or in other words gender neutral to create clothings that would best suit both genders. The arguments that menswear is suppose to be only ‘menswear’ interests her, therefore she's aiming and attempted to incorporate ‘masculinity’ into my womenswear collections and vice versa. She has also want to cross boundaries in fashion and reinvent forms of clothing while simultaneously transmitting the traditional qualities of culture into her work.
